# Conclusion
Below is a summary of the mutiple models tested on the sensing shirt data of a single subject. 


The initial motivation of this project was to create a sensing shirt that is capable of estimating the wearer's shoulder position. This goal aligns with our method of training and testing on a single subject, because the intended use case is to have tbe same user wear the sensing shirt - by training the model on.
